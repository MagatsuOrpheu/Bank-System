# Bank System

### This is the first challenge of the Python Development formation from DIO (DIgital Innovation One)

We need to create a bank system using python. For its first version it must have 3 operations: Deposit, Withdraw and Bank Statement.

In this version we will work with just one user.

All deposits must be stored in a variable and be available in the bank statement operation.

The system must only allow 3 daily withdrawals with a limit of just R$500. If the user doesn't have a balance available, a message must be displayed stating that it won't be possible due to lack of balance.

All withdrawals must be stored in a variable and be available in the bank statement operation.

The Statement operation must include all deposits and withdrawals made to the account, and at the end return the current balance of the account.

The format must be used: R$ xxxx.xx
